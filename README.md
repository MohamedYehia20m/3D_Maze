# 3D Maze Game in Python

## Introduction
This project is a simple 3D maze game built using Python and **Ray Casting** to simulate a 3D environment. The game demonstrates how 3D-like visuals can be achieved using 2D matrices, without relying on external game engines or complex graphics libraries.

---

## Installation

To run the game locally, you will need Python 3 and the required dependencies.

Required libraries:
- **Numpy** for handling numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib** for rendering graphics.
- **Keyboard** for capturing player input.


---

## Usage

Navigate the 3D maze using arrow keys. The game creates a pseudo-3D view by casting rays from the player's position and calculating the distance to walls, drawing vertical lines based on that distance.

**Controls:**
- **Arrow Keys**: Move and turn.
